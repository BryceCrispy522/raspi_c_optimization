# raspi_c_optimization
A group project focused on different optimization techniques and levels in programming. Tested on raspberry pi's

## Assignments

- [ ] Constant Folding - Graham
- [ ] Loop Unrolling - Jaden
- [ ] Dead Code Elimination - Bryce
- [ ] Loop Invariant Code Motion - Nicky
- [ ] Subexpression Elimination - Isaac
- [ ] General Code Motion - All?

## Steps
1. Add code examples to a folder titled your assignment:

```
constant_folding/
    - example1.c
    - example2.c
    - ...
loop_unrolling/
    - example1.c
    - example2.c
    - ...
```

3. Compile with each optimization level on the pi's
4. Profile with Massif - Memory and cache performance changes from original to optimized
5. Document all info in a table below
